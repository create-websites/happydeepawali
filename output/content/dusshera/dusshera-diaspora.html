                        <li><strong>Logistical Hurdles:</strong> Securing permits for big public events and effigy burnings is no simple task. Neighborhoods frequently collaborate with officials for months to meet regulations and prioritize safety.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sourcing Materials:</strong> Sourcing traditional items for pujas, decor, and effigies is often challenging. Locals rely on imports or craft inventive alternatives.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> Since Dussehra isn't a public holiday, key festivities are typically moved to the closest weekend, enabling families and professionals to join in completely.</li>
                        <li><strong>Passing on Traditions:</strong> The emphasis is on engaging the youth raised overseas through storytelling, workshops, and Ramlila performances to help them stay linked to their heritage.</li>
