  "From historic royal rituals to contemporary worldwide festivities, explore the evolving legacy of Dussehra through the ages.",
  "Dussehra's roots trace back to Hindu texts like the Ramayana and Devi Mahatmya. Historically, it held royal and martial importance, with kings venerating weapons and seeking blessings for post-monsoon campaigns. Festivals like Mysore Dasara, supported by the Vijayanagara dynasty and Wodeyars, introduced grand processions and royal assemblies still celebrated today. Elsewhere, it aligned with harvest cycles, honoring the divine feminine.",
  "Under the British Raj, public festivals underwent a transformation. As royal patronage waned in certain regions, Dussehra emerged as a unifying community event. Ramlila performances grew in popularity, fostering cultural identity and solidarity amidst colonial dominance. The idea of 'sarvajanik' (community-led) festivals took root, transferring the festivities from royal elites to the masses and subtly promoting nationalist sentiment.",
  "Post-1947, Dussehra emerged as a celebration of India's diverse and united heritage. The government took steps to encourage regional festivities, nurturing national pride and unity. Mysore Dasara was officially named the state festival ('Nada Habba'), while televised Ramlila performances on Doordarshan connected households nationwide, fostering a collective cultural identity and elevating Dussehra to a prominent pan-Indian event.",
  "Over the years, Dussehra has evolved under the influence of modernization and globalization. Innovative technologies now enhance Ramlilas and effigy burnings with dazzling light and sound displays. The festival has seen a surge in commercialization, marked by corporate sponsorships and a thriving festive market. At the same time, concerns about environmental impact have spurred a shift toward eco-friendly effigies and sustainable practices. For Indians living abroad, Dussehra serves as a meaningful bridge to their roots, fostering hybrid celebrations that merge Indian traditions with local culture, ensuring the heritage lives on."
