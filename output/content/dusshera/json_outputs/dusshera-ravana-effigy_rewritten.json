  "Discover the art of crafting your own Ravana effigy, blending tradition, creativity, and eco-friendly practices.",
  "This concept highlights timeless visuals: a towering form, ten unique heads, a bold mustache, and elaborate, royal garments crafted from vibrant paper. The goal is to embody the commanding and majestic essence of the demon king.",
  "Craft your effigy with eco-friendly materials. Opt for a bamboo structure, fill it with hay or dried leaves, and decorate using natural, non-toxic paints. This method honors the festival and protects the planet.",
  "Explore creative expression beyond the literal. Depict the ten heads (vices) using abstract forms, geometric patterns, and symbolic colors. This artistic approach offers a fresh perspective and makes for an engaging community art initiative.",
  "Used garments or vibrant paper for costumes, safe paints (such as tempera or plant-based dyes), and pens.",
  "Build the core structure with bamboo poles or rolled-up newspapers. Form a simple humanoid figure (vertical torso, two legs, and two arms) and fasten the joints tightly using jute rope.",
  "Fill the frame with dry grass or crumpled paper to add bulk. Secure the stuffing using twine, shaping a rounded torso, limbs, and legs.",
  "Cut out ten cardboard heads, with one larger for the center. Paint bold faces, a striking mustache, and a crown. Arrange them in a fan layout on a sturdy base.",
  "Wrap worn garments or vibrant paper around the body for Ravana's look. Use non-toxic paints and markers to add a dhoti, sash, and decorative ornaments.",
  "Securely attach the fan of heads to the top of the torso. Attach hands cut from cardboard to the arms. Your Ravana effigy is now ready!",
  "Avoid filling the effigy with firecrackers; they lead to pollution and loud disturbances.",
  "Avoid plastic, thermocol, or synthetic items that emit harmful fumes when incinerated.",
  "Conduct the symbolic burning outdoors, far from structures, vegetation, and anything flammable.",
  "Adult supervision is required at all times, particularly during the final burning ceremony."
