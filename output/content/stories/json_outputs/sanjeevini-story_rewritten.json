  "Amid the intense clash with Indrajit, Lakshmana, shielding Rama, was hit by the prince's deadly weapon, the Shakti. The celestial spear tore through his chest, leaving him unconscious and near death. A deep sorrow gripped the Vanara army, and for the first time, Lord Rama wept in anguish, his heart shattered by the sight of his fallen brother.",
  "The Vanara healer, Sushena, inspected Lakshmana and declared a single hope: atop the Dronagiri mountain in the Himalayas grew four sacred herbs. Among them, the Sanjeevani alone could revive life. Yet it had to arrive before dawn, or all would be in vain.",
  "The mountain lay hundreds of leagues distant, a journey no one could conquer in one night—no one but Hanuman.",
  "Without delay, Hanuman bowed to Rama and sprang powerfully northward. Yet Ravana, informed by his spies, resolved to thwart his mission.",
  "Growing to the size of a mountain, Hanuman leapt into the sky, his heart consumed by his lord's grief. He sped like a streak of thought, racing across the vast land on his urgent quest.",
  "As the clock ticked down and the herb remained unknown, Hanuman confronted a dire choice. His response was a feat of faith and strength so profound it entered the realm of legend.",
  "Perched atop the Dronagiri peak, he gazed at the mountain blanketed in thousands of luminous, enchanted herbs. Rushed and with their true forms obscured, he struggled to identify the Sanjeevani among them. A single error could cost him dearly.",
  "'If I fail to locate the herb,' he thought, 'I’ll just carry its origin.' Growing to a colossal size, he stretched his massive arms around the mountain's base and, with an earth-shaking effort, hoisted the entire Dronagiri peak high into the sky.",
  "Soaring back with the mountain in his grasp, Hanuman stunned the heavens with his might. As dawn's first light touched the earth, he returned to the battlefield. Sushena swiftly identified the Sanjeevani herb, prepared it, and applied it to Lakshmana. In moments, Lakshmana's injuries vanished, and he awakened as though from a deep slumber, fully restored. Cheers of victory erupted from the Vanara army. Rama hugged Hanuman tightly, his eyes glistening with gratitude, proclaiming his eternal indebtedness to his loyal companion.",
  "A dynamic retelling of Hanuman's heroic quest to rescue Lakshmana."
