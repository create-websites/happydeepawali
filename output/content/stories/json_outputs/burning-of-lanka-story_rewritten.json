  "His main task was done: he had located Sita and conveyed Rama's words. Yet Hanuman, the mighty and clever Wind God's son, realized leaving now would waste a chance. He chose to send a bolder message—one that would instill fear in Ravana and his realm.",
  "To assess the foe's power and declare his arrival, Hanuman wreaked havoc in the lush Ashok Vatika, tearing down trees and shattering buildings, sparing only the one sheltering Sita. This was a calculated move, daring Ravana to dispatch his mightiest warriors.",
  "Ravana's warriors approached to seize the \"troublesome monkey,\" but Hanuman vanquished them all, ending with the defeat of Ravana's son, Akshayakumara.",
  "At last, Ravana dispatched his strongest son, Indrajit. Hanuman willingly surrendered, seeking a chance to confront the Demon King face-to-face.",
  "Indrajit, wielder of divine arms, invoked the Brahmastra. Honoring the sacred gift from Lord Brahma, Hanuman permitted its binding force. Deceived by his restraint, the rakshasas hauled the mighty Vanara to Ravana's court.",
  "In the court, Hanuman announced himself as a messenger of Rama and demanded Sita's immediate return. Enraged by his audacity, Ravana ignored the counsel of his wise brother Vibhishana, who argued that an envoy cannot be killed. Instead, Ravana decreed a humiliating punishment: 'A monkey's pride is in its tail. Set it on fire!'",
  "Ravana's pride sealed his city's fate. The rakshasas eagerly bound Hanuman's tail in oil-drenched cloth, unaware of the divine force they had provoked.",
  "As the rakshasas fetched cloth, Hanuman began to magically stretch his tail. It kept growing longer, using up all the fabric in Lanka, yet still wasn’t fully wrapped. This was the first sign of the divine power they faced.",
  "His task complete, Hanuman dashed to the shore and doused the fire on his tail. Pausing briefly, he met Sita again, promising Rama's army was near. With resolve, he soared from Mount Arishta, a victorious hero heading back after exceeding every goal."
