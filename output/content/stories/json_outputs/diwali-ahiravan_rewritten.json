  "Amid the great war for Lanka, as Ravana faced near-certain defeat, he summoned his hidden ace: Ahiravan, his sorcerer brother and the malevolent ruler of Patala, the underworld. This tale unfolds his sinister scheme and Hanumanâ€™s fearless descent into the shadows to rescue his lords.",
  "Meet the formidable foe in this section. Tap the card to uncover Ahiravan's abilities and goals.",
  "Ahiravan, a dark arts master and devoted follower of goddess Mahamaya, ruled Patala's depths. Skilled in teleportation, illusion, and shapeshifting, he was called by Ravana to sacrifice Rama and Lakshmana in his shadowy temple, seeking supreme power beyond the battlefield.",
  "Sensing danger, Hanuman wove a protective fortress with his tail around Rama and Lakshmana's camp. Yet, Ahiravan, ever sly, disguised himself as Vibhishana, Ravana's virtuous brother and Rama's ally, to infiltrate the camp. With his dark sorcery, he plunged the Vanara army into a deep sleep and seized the unconscious Rama and Lakshmana, whisking them away to Patala for a dawn sacrifice.",
  "Upon learning of the abduction, a heartbroken Hanuman vowed to save his lords. With Vibhishana's guidance, he set forth on a daring mission to the underworld. Trace his journey by clicking on each step of his quest.",
  "Hanuman discovered the concealed gateway to the underworld, a shadowy, yawning chasm. Reducing himself to the size of a thumb, he dove into the depths, commencing his perilous journey.",
  "Within Ahiravan's temple, Hanuman discovered Rama and Lakshmana ready for sacrifice. Using his cunning and strength, he saved them. This part recounts his smart trickery and the fierce battle that ensued.",
  "Ahiravan's life was bound to five lamps, spread across different directions. To destroy them together, Hanuman unveiled his powerful Panchmukhi (five-faced) form: Hanuman, Hayagriva, Narasimha, Garuda, and Varaha. Each face exhaled in a unique direction, snuffing out the lamps instantly and shattering Ahiravan's immortality.",
  "With Ahiravan defeated, Hanuman clashed with him in a fierce duel. Taking his colossal form, Hanuman subdued the sorcerer king. Carrying Rama and Lakshmana on his shoulders, he soared to the surface and reached the Vanara camp at sunrise, rescuing his lords from peril."
