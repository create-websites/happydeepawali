  "In the grand tale of the Ramayana, Lord Rama faced the daunting challenge of crossing the ocean to Lanka. Nal and Neel, two ingenious Vanara engineers, stepped up and devised a plan to build a miraculous bridge—a timeless marvel of faith, skill, and divine grace, remembered in texts and visible even in satellite images today.",
  "Sita, the wife of Lord Rama, was taken by the demon king Ravana and imprisoned in Lanka. Rama's Vanara army gathered at the southern coast, staring at the mighty ocean. The daunting question loomed: how could they cross the sea to rescue Sita and confront Ravana?",
  "Meet the brilliant minds behind this sacred endeavor: two sons of Vishwakarma, the heavenly architect, gifted with his craft. Tap each profile to explore their distinct talents and vital contributions to this grand saga.",
  "Nal, the chief engineer of the project, was the son of Vishwakarma, inheriting natural expertise in construction and design. Blessed in childhood with a boon, anything he cast into water would float instead of sinking. This divine talent made the impossible bridge achievable.",
  "Neel, another son of Vishwakarma, served as a commander in Sugriva's army and was a masterful engineer. As Nal shaped the core design using his divine gift, Neel oversaw logistics, coordinated the vast Vanara labor force, and secured a swift, steady flow of materials. His strategic leadership was crucial in finishing the bridge with remarkable speed.",
  "The Ram Setu's construction was a remarkable feat of divine craftsmanship and efficient planning, finished in only five days. This segment highlights vital stats and offers an interactive timeline of the process. Dive into each day to witness the execution of this monumental endeavor.",
  "Under Neel's lead, the Vanara army started collecting huge rocks and trees. Guided by Nal, they built 14 yojanas of the bridge on the first day, driven by unwavering devotion to Lord Rama.",
  "Ram Setu isn’t merely a bridge; it stands as a lasting emblem of devotion and innovation. Blending myth with marvel, its tale merges divine intervention and human skill. Here, delve into two viewpoints: the ancient lore of floating stones and the contemporary scientific and satellite insights into its formation.",
  "At the heart of the tale lies Nal's sacred gift. It’s said that stones bearing Lord Rama’s name turned weightless in Nal's hands, floating on the ocean to create a sturdy bridge. Even tiny creatures, like squirrels, played their part, proving that devotion, not strength, held value. This story embodies the power of faith and perseverance to conquer any challenge.",
  "Satellite imagery from NASA and other agencies reveals a series of limestone shoals linking Rameswaram in India to Mannar Island in Sri Lanka, aligning with the site of Ram Setu. Some theories argue these may be pumice stones—light volcanic rocks that float—while others consider them a naturally formed chain of shoals. The formation continues to spark research and debate, bridging ancient lore with modern science.",
  "A hands-on dive into Nal and Neel's monumental engineering marvel."
