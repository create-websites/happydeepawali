  "A handy guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The much-anticipated moon on Karwa Chauth typically appears late in the evening. This isn't random but aligns with a stunning cosmic pattern. The timing depends on the moon's orbit, its placement in the sky, and Earth's location.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it's just four days after the full moon, the moon rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth night of the waning phase, moonrise shifts well beyond the timing on the full moon night.",
  "Your exact latitude and longitude decide when the moon rises, causing moonrise times to vary between cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. You'll also find details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the timings of the Chaturthi Tithi for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each evening after the full moon, causing Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, to align with a late moonrise.",
