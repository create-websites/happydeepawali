  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special day, observed on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The much-anticipated Karwa Chauth moon often graces the sky later in the evening. This timing isn't random but stems from the moon's orbital path, its celestial position, and Earth's geographical alignment.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it's just four days after the full moon, moonrise happens later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later each day. By the fourth waning night, this delay grows, making moonrise much later than it was on the full moon night.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—your latitude and longitude—sets the precise time the moon rises. This explains why times vary between locations.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi timings are included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each evening after the full moon, with Karwa Chauth on the fourth day aligning with a late moonrise in the cycle.",
  "The moon's arrival is more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the deep devotion within the marital bond. This waiting period forms the festival's emotional core, ending beautifully as the fast concludes with the moon's appearance."
