  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon's late rise on Karwa Chauth is no accident but a product of cosmic harmony. Its timing aligns with the moon's orbit, its position, and our place on Earth.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Just four days after the full moon, it naturally rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later each day. By day four of the waning phase, this delay becomes noticeable, shifting moonrise well past the timing on the full moon night.",
  "The exact time the moon rises depends on your location—latitude and longitude—causing moonrise timings to vary between cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Additionally, the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the timings for Chaturthi Tithi are included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each evening after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, aligns with a phase where the moon rises late.",
  "The moon's wait transcends ritual, embodying patience, love, sacrifice, and the deep commitment of marriage. This time of longing forms the festival's emotional core, ending beautifully as the fast breaks with the moon's rise."
