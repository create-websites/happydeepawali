  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special day, honored on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon on Karwa Chauth often rises late, following a natural cosmic rhythm. This delay stems from its orbital path, sky position, and our earthly vantage point.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it’s just four days after the full moon, the moon rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later each day. By day four of the waning phase, this delay becomes noticeable, setting moonrise much later than on the full moon night.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets when the moon rises, causing time differences between cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. You’ll also find details on the fasting hours (Puja Muhurat) and the timing of the Chaturthi Tithi for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each evening after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, aligns with a phase where the moon appears late.",
  "The moon's arrival signifies more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the unwavering devotion tied to marital bonds. This anticipation forms the festival's soul, ending beautifully as the fast concludes with the moon's ascent."
