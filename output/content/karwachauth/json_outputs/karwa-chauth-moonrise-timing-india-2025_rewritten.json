  "A handy guide to exploring the moon's timing on this special day, Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon's late rise on Karwa Chauth is no coincidence but a result of its celestial dance. Its timing is influenced by its orbit, position in the sky, and Earth's location.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it's just four days after the full moon, the moon rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later each day, so by the fourth day of waning, moonrise shifts well beyond its time on the full moon night.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets when the moon rises, causing city-to-city time differences.",
  "Choose your city to view the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration are also included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each night after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, occurs when the moon naturally appears later in the cycle.",
  "Awaiting the moon transcends tradition, embodying patience, love, sacrifice, and the deep devotion of marital ties. This poignant anticipation forms the festival's soul, climaxing as the fast ends with the moon's ascent."
