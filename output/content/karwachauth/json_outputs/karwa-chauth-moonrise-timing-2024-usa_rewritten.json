  "A hands-on guide to grasping the moon's schedule for this special day, honored on October 20, 2024.",
  "The moon on Karwa Chauth often graces the sky late in the evening, a result of its natural orbit, Earth's position, and the cosmic rhythm that governs it.",
  "Karwa Chauth is observed on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). As it occurs just four days after the full moon, the moon rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later daily. By the fourth waning day, this delay becomes noticeable, making moonrise much later than it was on the full moon night.",
  "Your exact position on Earth, defined by your latitude and longitude, sets the precise moment the moon rises. This explains why times vary between different cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Sunday, October 20, 2024. Details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration are also available for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each night after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, aligns with a phase where the moon emerges late.",
  "The moon's arrival is more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion woven into marital ties. This wait transforms into the festival's soul, ending with the heartfelt moment of breaking the fast."
