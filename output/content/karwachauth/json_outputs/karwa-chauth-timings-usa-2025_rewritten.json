  "A hands-on guide to grasping the moon's schedule on this special Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon on Karwa Chauth often rises late, a result of its natural orbit, Earth's position, and cosmic harmony. This delay aligns with the celestial rhythm, creating a beautiful tradition.",
  "Karwa Chauth is observed on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). As it's just four days after the full moon, the moon rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth waning day, moonrise shifts well past the timing of the full moon.",
  "The exact time the moon rises depends on your latitude and longitude, which is why moonrise varies between different cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. The fasting schedule (Puja Muhurat) and Chaturthi Tithi timings are included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each evening after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, aligns with a phase when the moon shows up late.",
  "The moon's wait transcends ritual, embodying patience, love, sacrifice, and the deep devotion within marriage. This anticipation forms the festival's emotional core, peaking as the fast ends with the moon's rise."
