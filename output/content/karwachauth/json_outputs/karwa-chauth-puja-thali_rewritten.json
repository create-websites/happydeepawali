  "The tale follows Veeravati, a stunning queen and cherished sister to seven devoted brothers. During her first Karwa Chauth, she kept a rigorous fast at her parents' house. By nightfall, weak from hunger and thirst, she anxiously awaited the moonrise. Unable to watch her suffer, her brothers devised a trick. They used a mirror in a pipal tree with a flame behind a sieve to mimic the moon's glow.",
  "Mistaking a false moon for the real one, Veeravati ended her fast. Just as she ate, word came that her husband, the king, was critically ill. Devastated, she hurried to his side but encountered Goddess Parvati, who exposed her brothers' trickery. The Goddess urged her to reobserve the fast with true devotion. Veeravati complied, and her steadfast faith compelled Yama, the god of death, to revive her husband. Since then, women have observed the tradition of viewing the moon through a sieve, inspired by Veeravati's tale and praying for their husbands' longevity.",
