  "The long wait for the moon on Karwa Chauth is no accident—it’s the result of a stunning cosmic rhythm. The timing depends on the moon's orbit, its position, and where we are on Earth.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it's just four days after the full moon, moonrise happens later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth waning night, its rise is much delayed compared to the full moon.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets when the moon rises, causing city-to-city timing differences.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi timings are included for your ease.",
