  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special day, honored on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The much-anticipated moon on Karwa Chauth typically graces the sky late in the evening. This isn't mere chance but part of a stunning cosmic harmony. The timing is influenced by the moon's orbit, its celestial position, and where we stand on Earth.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha), with moonrise happening later in the evening as it's just four days after the full moon.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth waning night, its rise is much delayed compared to the full moon.",
  "The moon's rise time varies by city because its appearance over the horizon is dictated by your exact latitude and longitude on Earth.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. You'll also find the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the timing of the Chaturthi Tithi for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each night after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth evening, aligns with a phase where the moon shows up late.",
  "The moon's arrival is more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the deep commitment of marriage. This wait transforms into the festival's soul, ending beautifully as the fast breaks under its glow."
