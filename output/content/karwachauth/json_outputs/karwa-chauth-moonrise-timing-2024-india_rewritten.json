  "A hands-on guide to grasping the moon's schedule for this special day, observed on October 20, 2024.",
  "The long-awaited moon on Karwa Chauth typically graces the sky late in the evening. This timing isnâ€™t random but reflects a stunning cosmic harmony. The delay stems from the moon's orbit, its celestial position, and Earth's location.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Just four days after the full moon, it naturally rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth waning night, moonrise shifts well beyond its full moon timing.",
  "Your exact latitude and longitude decide when the moon rises, causing timing to vary between locations.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Sunday, October 20, 2024. Details about the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi timing are included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows the moon rising later each evening after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on day four, aligns with a phase when the moon appears late.",
  "Awaiting the moon is more than tradition; it symbolizes patience, love, sacrifice, and the deep devotion within a marital bond. This anticipation forms the emotional essence of the festival, ending beautifully as the fast breaks with the moon's ascent."
