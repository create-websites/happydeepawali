  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon’s schedule on this special occasion, observed on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon on Karwa Chauth often rises late, a result of its natural orbit, Earth's position, and celestial harmony.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). As it’s just four days after the full moon, the moon rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth waning day, moonrise shifts well beyond the time of the full moon night.",
  "The exact time the moon rises depends on your location—latitude and longitude—causing variations between different cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on fasting hours (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration are included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows the moon rising later each night after the full moon, with Karwa Chauth on day four naturally aligning when the moon appears late.",
  "The moon's arrival signifies more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion that defines marital ties. This waiting period forms the emotional core of the festival, ending beautifully as the fast concludes under the moonlit sky."
