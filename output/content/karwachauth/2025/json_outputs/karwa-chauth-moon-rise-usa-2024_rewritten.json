  "A hands-on guide to grasping the moon's schedule for this special day, honored on October 20, 2024.",
  "The moon on Karwa Chauth often graces the sky later in the evening, a result of its natural orbit. This timing aligns with the celestial dance of its position and Earth's location, creating a beautiful cosmic harmony.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). As it's just four days after the full moon, the moon rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth waning night, moonrise shifts much later than it was on the full moon.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets when the moon rises, causing times to vary between cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Sunday, October 20, 2024. Details on fasting hours (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration are included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each evening after the full moon, with Karwa Chauth on the fourth day aligning when the moon appears late.",
  "The moon's arrival is more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion woven into marital ties. This wait transforms into the festival's soul, ending beautifully as the fast breaks under its glow."
