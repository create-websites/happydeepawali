  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special day, honored on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon on Karwa Chauth often rises late, following a graceful cosmic rhythm. This timing aligns with its orbital path, its position above, and our place on Earth.",
  "Karwa Chauth is observed on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Just days after the full moon, it rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, so by the fourth waning day, moonrise shifts much later compared to the full moon night.",
  "Your exact latitude and longitude dictate when the moon rises, which is why its timing varies between different cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. You'll also find details on the fasting period (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each night after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, typically occurs when the moon is naturally delayed.",
  "The moon's arrival transcends ritual, embodying patience, love, sacrifice, and the devotion within a marital bond. This waiting period forms the festival's emotional core, ending beautifully as the fast concludes with the moon's appearance."
