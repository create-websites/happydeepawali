  "A hands-on guide to grasping the moon's schedule on this special Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The moon on Karwa Chauth often rises late, guided by a cosmic rhythm. This timing isn't random; it's shaped by the moon's orbit, its position, and Earth's location.",
  "Karwa Chauth occurs on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha), with the moon rising later in the evening, just four days after the full moon.",
  "The moon rises about 50 minutes later daily, and by the fourth day of waning, this delay becomes notable, making moonrise much later than on full moon night.",
  "Your location's latitude and longitude dictate when the moon rises, causing times to vary between cities.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. Details on fasting hours (Puja Muhurat) and the Chaturthi Tithi duration are included for your ease.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises later each evening after a full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, aligns with a phase when the moon appears late.",
  "The moon's arrival is more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the deep devotion of marital ties. This wait transforms into the soul of the festival, ending with the heartfelt breaking of the fast under its glow."
