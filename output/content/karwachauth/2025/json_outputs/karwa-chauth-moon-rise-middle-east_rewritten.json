  "A hands-on guide to exploring the moon's schedule on this special day, honored on Friday, October 10, 2025.",
  "The much-anticipated moon on Karwa Chauth typically appears later in the evening. This isn’t mere chance but stems from a graceful cosmic pattern. The timing is influenced by the moon's orbital path, its position, and Earth's geography.",
  "Karwa Chauth is observed on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the moon's waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Since it's just four days after the full moon, the moon rises later in the evening.",
  "The moon appears about 50 minutes later each day, so by the fourth night of its waning phase, moonrise occurs much later than it did on the full moon.",
  "Your exact spot on Earth—latitude and longitude—sets when the moon rises. This explains why times vary between locations.",
  "Choose your city to check the expected moonrise time for Karwa Chauth on Friday, October 10, 2025. You'll also find the fasting schedule (Puja Muhurat) and details of the Chaturthi Tithi for your reference.",
  "This chart shows how the moon rises progressively later each night after the full moon. Karwa Chauth, on the fourth day, aligns with a phase when the moon rises late.",
  "The moon's arrival signifies more than tradition; it embodies patience, love, sacrifice, and the deep devotion of marriage. This anticipation forms the festival's soul, ending beautifully as the fast concludes with the moon’s appearance."
