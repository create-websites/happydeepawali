    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This page narrates the ultimate act of devotion and is structured to build from a formal court setting to a moment of profound spiritual revelation. 1) The Royal Assembly sets the joyous scene of post-coronation celebrations. 2) The Precious Gift details Sita's gesture of gratitude. 3) A Puzzling Act is the core interactive section, using a step-based diagram to show Hanuman's seemingly disrespectful actions with the necklace, creating confusion and tension in the court. 4) The Ultimate Proof provides the dramatic climax, using tabs to separate his profound "Explanation" from the final, awe-inspiring "Revelation" of his heart. 5) Devotion Personified concludes with the story's powerful moral. This structure effectively transforms a simple anecdote into a powerful lesson on the nature of true devotion. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Hanuman's actions with the necklace -> Goal: Show a confusing but deliberate sequence -> Viz/Method: Interactive step-based diagram -> Interaction: Click steps for The Gift, The Inspection, and The Rejection -> Justification: This builds a sense of mystery and allows the user to follow the court's own confusion, making the final revelation more impactful. | Report Info: Hanuman's explanation and final act -> Goal: Detail the climax -> Viz/Method: Tabbed content -> Interaction: Tabs for "The Reason" and "The Proof" -> Justification: This separates the philosophical explanation from the miraculous physical proof, giving weight to both his words and his actions, and leading to a powerful conclusion. -->

                After Rama's grand coronation, the royal assembly of Ayodhya was filled with joy and celebration. King Rama and Queen Sita began distributing precious gifts to their allies and devotees as tokens of their immense gratitude. Sugriva, Vibhishana, Angada, and all the other Vanara heroes were honored for their service. Finally, it was Hanuman's turn.

            <p class="text-center text-stone-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">Looking at Hanuman with tears of affection, Sita removed her own priceless pearl necklace, a gift from her father Janaka, and placed it around Hanuman's neck. The entire court applauded, recognizing this as the highest honor bestowed upon the greatest of devotees.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-600">"To me," Hanuman explained calmly, "any object in this universe is worthless if it does not contain the name of my Lord Rama.

                        <p class="text-stone-600">A courtier scoffed, "If Rama's name is so important, is it inscribed on your own body?" With a gentle smile, Hanuman replied, "He is not merely on my body; He is my very life-breath." In a swift, stunning motion, he dug his powerful fingernails into his own chest and tore it wide open. There, seated within his heart, the entire assembly saw a divine, glowing image of Lord Rama and Mother Sita.</p>

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto text-stone-600">
                The court was left breathless and humbled, tears flowing from every eye. Rama, overcome with emotion, stepped down from his throne and embraced his perfect devotee, magically healing the wound. He blessed Hanuman, declaring that as long as the story of Rama is told on this earth, Hanuman's name would be revered, and his presence felt. Hanuman's act demonstrated that true value lies not in external treasures, but in the internal, unwavering presence of the divine.
