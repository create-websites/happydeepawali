    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This page narrates the final, climactic battle of the epic and is structured to build maximum tension and awe. 1) The Last Stand sets the scene of a cornered, rage-filled Ravana. 2) The Divine Arsenal highlights the cosmic significance of the duel by introducing the divine aid given to Rama. 3) The Unending Duel is the central interactive section, breaking down the ferocious, multi-stage battle into clear, escalating steps to convey its epic nature. 4) The Brahmastra focuses on the ultimate turning point‚Äîthe invocation of the final, divine weapon. 5) The Fall of a King provides the powerful conclusion to the war and the story. This structure ensures a dramatic and satisfying narrative arc for the epic's climax. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: The divine chariot and weapons sent for Rama -> Goal: Show Cosmic Intervention/Significance -> Viz/Method: Interactive card -> Interaction: Button click to "View Divine Aid" revealing details about Indra's chariot and weapons -> Justification: This emphasizes that the battle is not just between two mortals but a cosmic event. | Report Info: The multi-stage final battle -> Goal: Detail a long and complex duel -> Viz/Method: Interactive step-based diagram -> Interaction: Click steps for The Clash, The Immortal Heads, and The Mortal Secret -> Justification: This breaks down the seemingly endless battle into key phases, making it understandable and highlighting the critical turning point (Vibhishana's secret). | Report Info: The firing of the Brahmastra -> Goal: Emphasize the final, decisive action -> Viz/Method: Focused text and visual element -> Justification: This creates a moment of high drama, isolating the single most important action of the war for maximum impact. -->

                With his sons, brothers, and greatest warriors slain, Ravana was the last champion of Lanka. Consumed by a grief and rage that burned hotter than any fire, he performed sacred rituals to augment his power and ascended his divine chariot. The sky darkened as the ten-headed king of the rakshasas stormed onto the battlefield for his final, fateful confrontation with Rama.

                Armed with this knowledge, Rama invoked the most powerful weapon in existence‚Äîthe Brahmastra, an arrow gifted to him by the sage Agastya. This was no ordinary weapon; it contained the primordial power of the creator, Lord Brahma.

                Rama drew his bowstring to his ear and released the Brahmastra. It flew across the battlefield with an unerring aim, pierced Ravana's chest, struck the vessel of nectar in his navel, and returned to Rama's quiver. The great king of Lanka, the conqueror of the three worlds, dropped his weapons and fell from his chariot, his life force extinguished. The war was over. The heavens rained down flowers, divine music filled the air, and a great calm descended upon the earth. Dharma had been restored.
