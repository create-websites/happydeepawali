    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This page tells a charming childhood incident and is structured to highlight the innocence and immense power of young Hanuman. 1) A Divine Birth introduces his parentage and the source of his power. 2) The Forbidden Fruit is the core narrative, presented as an interactive step-by-step journey showing his innocent mistake and cosmic leap. 3) A God's Intervention details the consequences, using tabs to separate Indra's angry reaction from the subsequent blessings bestowed by all the gods. 4) A Power Curtailed provides the resolution to the story, explaining the childhood curse that made him forget his powers. This structure presents the tale as a complete and compelling character origin story. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Hanuman's leap toward the sun -> Goal: Show a sequence of events -> Viz/Method: Interactive step-based diagram -> Interaction: Click steps for The Mistake, The Leap, and The Pursuit -> Justification: Breaks down a fantastical event into a simple, charming, and easy-to-follow narrative for the user. | Report Info: The gods' reaction (Indra's anger vs. the boons) -> Goal: Compare/Contrast divine responses -> Viz/Method: Tabbed content -> Interaction: Tabs for "Indra's Wrath" and "The Shower of Boons" -> Justification: This effectively contrasts the immediate, harsh reaction with the ultimate, benevolent outcome, showcasing the divine importance of the child Hanuman. -->

                Long before he was a mighty hero, Hanuman was a divine child named Maruti, born to the Vanara queen Anjana and King Kesari. Blessed by Vayu, the Wind God, he was endowed with unimaginable strength, speed, and a mischievous spirit that knew no bounds. This is the story of his very first epic adventure.

Surya, the Sun God, was unconcerned by the child's attempt, but Rahu, the celestial being responsible for eclipses, saw Hanuman as a challenger.

Agni, the Fire God, blessed him to be unharmed by fire. From that day on, because of his injured jaw, he was known as Hanuman.</p>

                Now immortal and more powerful than ever, the young Hanuman continued his mischief. To protect the world (and himself) from his own innocent but destructive power, the sages placed a mild curse on him: he would forget the true extent of his abilities. He would live as a normal Vanara, his divine powers dormant, until the day a wise soul would remind him of his true nature for a cause of great importance.
