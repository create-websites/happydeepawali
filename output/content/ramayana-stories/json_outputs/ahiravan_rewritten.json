  "Amid the epic war for Lanka, as Ravana faced near defeat, he summoned his hidden ace: Ahiravan, his sinister sorcerer brother and ruler of Patala, the underworld. This tale unfolds his wicked scheme and Hanuman's unyielding loyalty, venturing into the abyss to rescue his masters.",
  "Meet the fierce antagonist in this section. Tap the card to uncover Ahiravan's abilities and driving forces.",
  "Ahiravan, a dark arts master and devout worshiper of goddess Mahamaya, ruled the underground Patala. Gifted with teleportation, illusion, and shapeshifting, he was called by Ravana to sacrifice Rama and Lakshmana in his shadowy temple, seeking supreme power.",
  "Sensing danger, Hanuman used his tail to build a protective fortress around Rama and Lakshmana's camp. However, Ahiravan was devious. Disguising himself as Vibhishana, Ravana's noble brother and ally of Rama, he infiltrated the camp. With his magic, he cast a powerful sleep spell on the Vanara army and seized the unconscious Rama and Lakshmana, whisking them to his realm in Patala for a dawn sacrifice.",
  "Learning of the abduction, a heartbroken Hanuman vowed to save his lords. With Vibhishana's guidance, he set out on a daring quest to the underworld. Trace his journey by exploring each step of his mission.",
  "Hanuman discovered the concealed gateway to the underworld, a shadowy, sunken passage. He reduced himself to the size of a thumb and dove into the depths, embarking on his perilous journey.",
  "Within Ahiravan's temple, Hanuman discovered Rama and Lakshmana ready for sacrifice. Relying on his wit and strength, he devised a cunning plan and fought a fierce battle to rescue them.",
  "Ahiravan's life was tied to five lamps, set in separate directions. To snuff them out together, Hanuman assumed his grand Panchmukhi (five-faced) form: Hanuman, Hayagriva, Narasimha, Garuda, and Varaha. Each face blew a lamp out in unison, ending Ahiravan's immortality.",
  "With Ahiravan defeated, Hanuman clashed with him in an intense fight. Taking his colossal form, Hanuman subdued the sorcerer king. He lifted Rama and Lakshmana onto his shoulders and soared back to the surface, reaching the Vanara camp at sunrise, rescuing his lords from near death."
