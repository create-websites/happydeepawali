  "Long before his legendary heroics, Hanuman was Maruti, a divine child born to Vanara queen Anjana and King Kesari. Gifted by Vayu, the Wind God, he possessed incredible strength, unmatched speed, and an unbridled mischievous nature. This tale recounts his very first epic journey.",
  "From birth, Maruti had the gift of shape-shifting and flight. As a mischievous child, he used his vast powers to playfully bother the forest sages, tugging at their beards and interrupting their rituals, all in harmless jest.",
  "Born of the Wind God, he moved with the wild speed of a gale, brimming with boundless energy and celestial wonder.",
  "One morning, young Maruti awoke with a rumbling stomach. Glancing around, he noticed a radiant, reddish-orange sphere climbing the eastern sky. To his naive gaze, it resembled a luscious, juicy mango, ripe for the picking.",
  "\"What a beautiful fruit!\" he mused. His mother had gone to fetch actual fruits for him, but his insatiable hunger and intrigue got the better of him. In an instant, he resolved to feast on that enormous 'mango' for breakfast.",
  "The gods watched in dismay. Surya, the Sun God, remained indifferent to the child’s act, but Rahu, the eclipse-causing celestial, viewed Hanuman as a rival. He took the matter to Indra, king of the gods, who deemed the child’s untamed power a danger to cosmic balance.",
  "Mounted on his celestial white elephant, Airavata, Indra faced the airborne child. When Maruti defied his commands, Indra hurled his mighty Vajra (thunderbolt), hitting the child’s jaw (Hanu) and knocking him unconscious as he fell to the earth.",
  "Witnessing his lifeless son, Vayu, overcome with sorrow, withdrew the air, choking all life. To calm him, the gods revived the boy and gifted him extraordinary boons. Brahma granted him protection from the Brahmastra. Indra made him invulnerable to the Vajra. Agni ensured fire could not harm him. Since that day, due to his injured jaw, he was called Hanuman.",
  "Now immortal and mightier than ever, young Hanuman kept up his playful antics. To shield the world—and him—from his innocent yet chaotic strength, the sages cast a gentle curse: he would forget the vastness of his powers. Living as an ordinary Vanara with his divinity hidden, his true potential would awaken only when a wise soul unveiled it for a momentous purpose."
