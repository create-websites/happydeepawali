  "Following Rama's grand coronation, Ayodhya's royal court brimmed with joy and festivity. King Rama and Queen Sita graciously bestowed priceless gifts upon their allies and devotees as symbols of deep gratitude. Sugriva, Vibhishana, Angada, and the valiant Vanara warriors were duly honored. At last, it was Hanuman's moment.",
  "With tears of affection, Sita took off her priceless pearl necklace, a cherished gift from her father Janaka, and gently adorned Hanuman's neck. The court erupted in applause, acknowledging this as the highest honor for the greatest devotee.",
  "The necklace held priceless value, not for its worth alone, but for the boundless love and care it carried.",
  "Hanuman received the gift with a humble bow, yet his next move startled and baffled everyone present. His act of pure devotion was mistaken for an insult.",
  "Hanuman picked up the necklace, plucked a pearl, brought it to his ear, then bit into it. His face fell with a tinge of disappointment.",
  "Hanuman's reply went beyond words, revealing a profound spiritual truth that left the court in awe and redefined the essence of devotion.",
  "Hanuman calmly said, \"To me, any object is meaningless if it lacks my Lord Rama's name. I was searching these pearls for the sacred name 'Rama.' As it isnâ€™t present, this necklace means nothing to me.\"",
  "A courtier scoffed, 'If Rama's name is so important, is it inscribed on your own body?' With a gentle smile, Hanuman replied, 'He is not merely on my body; He is my very life-breath.' In a swift, stunning motion, he dug his powerful fingernails into his own chest and tore it wide open. There, seated within his heart, the entire assembly saw a divine, glowing image of Lord Rama and Mother Sita.",
  "The court fell silent, awash with emotion as tears streamed freely. Rama, deeply moved, descended from his throne to embrace his devoted Hanuman, miraculously mending the wound. He blessed him, proclaiming that Hanuman's name would live on, honored wherever Rama's tale is told. Hanuman's deed revealed that true worth resides not in outward riches, but in the steadfast inner connection to the divine."
