    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This page tells a story of profound grace and is structured to build a sense of mystery and then deliver an emotional climax. 1) The Journey Begins sets the scene with the young princes and their mentor. 2) The Silent Hermitage creates suspense by describing the eerie, abandoned ashram. 3) The Tale of a Curse is the core explanatory section, using tabs to separate the story of Indra's "Deception" from Gautama's "Harsh Curse," making the complex backstory clear. 4) The Divine Redemption is the interactive climax, detailing Rama's act of liberation in a step-by-step narrative. 5) A Lesson in Compassion provides a thoughtful conclusion on the story's meaning. This structure guides the user from curiosity to understanding and finally to a feeling of profound relief and grace. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: The backstory of Ahalya's curse -> Goal: Explain a tragic history -> Viz/Method: Tabbed content -> Interaction: Tabs for "The Deception" and "The Curse" -> Justification: This effectively separates the sin from the punishment, allowing the user to understand both facets of the tragedy and the injustice Ahalya suffered. | Report Info: The moment of liberation -> Goal: Detail a magical, transformative event -> Viz/Method: Interactive step-based diagram -> Interaction: Click steps for The Eerie Stillness, The Divine Touch, and A Soul Redeemed -> Justification: This breaks down the miraculous event into a powerful, emotional sequence, building anticipation for the final, joyous outcome. -->

            <p class="mt-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-stone-500">
                In their youth, the princes Rama and Lakshmana traveled under the tutelage of the great sage Vishwamitra, learning the arts of war and the path of Dharma. As they journeyed through a dense, ancient forest, Vishwamitra led them to a desolate and strangely silent hermitage, a place that held a story of tragedy and a long-awaited prophecy.

            <p class="text-center text-stone-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">The ashrama was beautiful, yet eerily empty. No birds sang, no animals moved, and an air of profound sorrow hung over the well-kept but uninhabited huts. Rama, sensitive to the spiritual atmosphere, asked Vishwamitra why such a divine place felt so forsaken. The sage then revealed the story of its cursed mistress, Ahalya.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-600">Indra, the king of gods, lusted after Ahalya. Knowing she was devoted to her husband, he resorted to trickery. He took the form of a crow and crowed at midnight, tricking Gautama into thinking it was dawn and time for his morning rituals. When the sage left for the river, Indra assumed Gautama's form and approached Ahalya.</p>

In a fit of rage, he cursed Indra, but he saved his harshest punishment for his wife. He cursed Ahalya to become a stone, invisible to all living beings, to live on nothing but air, and to perform penance in solitude for millennia until she was purified by the touch of Rama's foot.</p>

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto text-stone-600">
                Ahalya's liberation was one of Rama's first acts of divine grace, demonstrating his role as a redeemer of the fallen. The event teaches the profound power of compassion and forgiveness over judgment and anger. While Gautama's curse represented rigid, unforgiving justice, Rama's touch symbolized unconditional grace, showing that even those who have erred, especially when deceived, are worthy of a second chance.
