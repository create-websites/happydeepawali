    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This page narrates a desperate race against time and is structured to build tension and highlight Hanuman's power. 1) A Mortal Wound establishes the dire crisis with Lakshmana's fall. 2) The Only Cure introduces the near-impossible solution, creating a ticking clock. 3) The Race Against Time is the core interactive section, detailing Hanuman's perilous journey and the obstacles he overcomes. 4) A Mountain in Hand focuses on the story's climax, using tabs to explain his dilemma and the audacious solution. 5) The Hero's Return provides the triumphant resolution. This chronological structure effectively conveys the urgency and immense scale of Hanuman's feat. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: The journey and its obstacles -> Goal: Show a perilous sequence -> Viz/Method: Interactive step-based diagram -> Interaction: Click steps for The Vow, The Deception, and The Confusion -> Justification: This breaks the long journey into key narrative challenges, building suspense before the final act. | Report Info: Hanuman's decision-making on the mountain -> Goal: Explain a critical choice -> Viz/Method: Tabbed content -> Interaction: Tabs for "The Dilemma" (can't find the herb) and "The Divine Solution" (lift the mountain) -> Justification: This isolates the pivotal moment of the story, clearly presenting the problem and Hanuman's incredible, out-of-the-box solution, thereby emphasizing his power and devotion. -->

                During the ferocious battle with Indrajit, Lakshmana, while defending Rama, was struck by the prince's most powerful weapon, the Shakti. The divine missile pierced his chest, and he fell to the ground, unconscious and on the verge of death. A wave of despair washed over the Vanara army, and for the first time, Lord Rama wept with grief, his heart breaking at the sight of his beloved brother.

In the high Himalayas, on the Dronagiri mountain, grew four divine herbs. Of these, the Sanjeevani was the only one that could restore life. But it had to be brought before the next sunrise, or all would be lost.</p>

                Flying back with the mountain in one hand, Hanuman was a sight that awed the heavens. Just as the first rays of dawn were breaking, he arrived back at the battlefield. Sushena quickly found the Sanjeevani herb, crushed it, and administered it to Lakshmana. Instantly, Lakshmana's wounds healed, and he rose as if from a deep sleep, strong and whole once more. A roar of triumph and joy erupted from the Vanara army. Rama embraced Hanuman, his eyes filled with tears of gratitude, declaring his debt to his devoted servant to be eternal.
