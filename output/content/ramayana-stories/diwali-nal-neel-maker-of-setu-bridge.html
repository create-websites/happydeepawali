    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page, scrolling narrative structure is chosen to guide the user through the story of Nal and Neel in a logical, chronological flow. It starts with an introduction (the problem), introduces the heroes (the architects), details their work (the project), explores its context (science vs. legend), and concludes with its impact (legacy). This storytelling approach is more engaging for a historical/mythological topic than a dashboard. Key interactions include clickable character bios, an interactive 5-day construction timeline, and tabs to compare legend with modern views, making the information digestible and explorable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Nal & Neel's identity -> Goal: Inform -> Viz/Method: Interactive HTML cards -> Interaction: Click to reveal bio -> Justification: Focuses on the key figures individually. | Report Info: 5-day bridge construction -> Goal: Show Change/Process -> Viz/Method: Interactive HTML/CSS timeline -> Interaction: Click on a day to see progress details -> Justification: Breaks down the monumental task into a manageable, explorable process. | Report Info: Legend of floating stones vs. science -> Goal: Compare/Organize -> Viz/Method: HTML Tabbed content -> Interaction: Click tabs to switch views -> Justification: Presents two perspectives on the same phenomenon clearly and concisely. No complex data charts are needed; the focus is on narrative and process. -->

                In the epic Ramayana, when Lord Rama faced the impossible task of crossing the ocean to Lanka, two brilliant engineers from the Vanara army, Nal and Neel, rose to the occasion. They masterminded the construction of a legendary bridge, a feat of devotion, engineering, and divine power that endures in scripture and satellite imagery to this day.

                    Sita, Lord Rama's wife, had been abducted by the demon king Ravana and was held captive in Lanka. Rama's army of Vanaras stood at the southern shore of the Indian subcontinent, faced with the vast, tumultuous ocean. The challenge was monumental: how to transport an entire army across the sea to wage war and rescue Sita.

Crucially, he had received a boon in his childhood: any object he threw into the water would not sink, but float. This divine gift was the key to making the seemingly impossible bridge a reality.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-600">The core of the legend is Nal's divine boon. It's believed the rocks and mountains, inscribed with Lord Rama's name, would become weightless when placed by Nal in the ocean, allowing them to float and form a stable, strong structure. Even the smallest creatures, like a squirrel, contributed, showing that devotion, not size, was what mattered. This act symbolizes that with faith and dedication, any obstacle can be overcome.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-600">Satellite images from agencies like NASA show a chain of limestone shoals between Rameswaram, India, and Mannar Island, Sri Lanka, which corresponds to the location of Ram Setu. Some scientific theories suggest these could be pumice stones, which are volcanic rocks filled with air pockets that can float. Others propose it is a natural formation of shoals. The structure remains a topic of active research and debate, connecting ancient text to modern scientific inquiry.</p>
